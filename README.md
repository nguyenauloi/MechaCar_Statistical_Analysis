## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
<img src="temp" width="600">

 1. Which varibles/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
    - Vehicle length and ground clearance are the most likely variables to provide non-random amounts of variance. We see the t-value of these two variables in order of magnitude higher than the other variables indicating to us that they hold a significant amount of consequence to miles per gallon
 2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? 
    - We can see the estimate indicates, while some are extremely close to, the slope of the linear model is non-zero. 
 3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar protoypes effectively?
    - Since our r-squared value is 0.71 we can be fairly confident in its predictive capability. Though, it is always important to remember not to view things in a vacuum as other factors beyond the scope of this dataset could also be a contributing factor.
